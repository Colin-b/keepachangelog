## [2.0.0.dev1] - 2021-05-27

### Fixed
- `keepachangelog.to_dict` now contains releases that have a URL but no section.

### Changed

- `keepachangelog.to_dict` now contains `metadata` key where `version`, `release_date`, `semantic_version` and `url` have been moved.
- `keepachangelog.to_raw_dict` now contains `metadata` key where `version`, `release_date`, `semantic_version` and `url` have been moved.
- As `keepachangelog.starlette.add_changelog_endpoint` is returning data as returned by `keepachangelog.to_dict`, the endpoint output is now modified.

## [1.0.0] - 2021-05-21
### Changed

### Added
- `keepachangelog.release` is now allowing to provide a custom new version thanks to the new `new_version` parameter.

### Fixed
- `keepachangelog.release` now allows `pre-release` and `build metadata` information as part of valid semantic version. As per [semantic versioning specifications](https://semver.org).
  To ensure compatibility with some python specific versioning, `pre-release` is also handled as not being prefixed with `-`, or prefixed with `.`.
- `keepachangelog.release` will now bump a pre-release version to a stable version. It was previously failing.

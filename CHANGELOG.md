# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0.dev3] - 2022-01-30
### Added
- The parsing engine is now Object-oriented and more flexible.
- Three new features:
  - **Multiline:** Items ( <-- such as this one) can now
    be written on several lines.
  - **Sub-items:** Items can now have sub-items.
    - Of any (reasonable) depth.
  - **To list:** Using `to_list` instead of `to_dict` makes it possible to sort it easily.

### Changed
- Release dates are parsed (several formats are supported). 
  When `to_dict()`, a unique format is chosen.
- When `to_raw_dict()`, release dates are kept "as-is" 
  (and `.lower()` is no longer applied)

### Fixed
- Change ordering is now deterministic
- When `to_raw_dict()`, empty lines are preserved.
- When semantic version exists, it is produced. Before, if 
  depended on some bugs (it was produced sometimes and not 
  other times, such as when the change was empty or if there 
  was only the link, something like that...). 
  This is now more consistent.

## [2.0.0.dev2] - 2021-08-04
### Fixed
- `keepachangelog.release` will now properly bump version in case the number of digit to compare was previously increased (such as if version 9 and 10 existed).

### Added
- `keepachangelog.to_sorted_semantic` to be able to sort semantic versions.

## [2.0.0.dev1] - 2021-05-27
### Changed
- `keepachangelog.release` will now return `None` instead of throwing an exception if there is no Unreleased content.

## [2.0.0.dev0] - 2021-05-27
### Fixed
- `keepachangelog.to_dict` now contains releases that have a URL but no section.
- `keepachangelog.to_raw_dict` now contains releases that have a URL but no section.

### Changed
- `keepachangelog.to_dict` now contains `uncategorized` key for each item if uncategorized information are available for the version.
- `keepachangelog.to_dict` now contains `metadata` key where `version`, `release_date`, `semantic_version` and `url` have been moved.
- `keepachangelog.to_raw_dict` now contains `metadata` key where `version`, `release_date`, `semantic_version` and `url` have been moved.
- As `keepachangelog.starlette.add_changelog_endpoint` is returning data as returned by `keepachangelog.to_dict`, the endpoint output is now modified.
- As `keepachangelog.flask_restx.add_changelog_endpoint` is returning data as returned by `keepachangelog.to_dict`, the endpoint output is now modified.

### Added
- `keepachangelog.from_dict` to create a changelog content based on a dictionary.
- `keepachangelog.to_dict` now allows to provide any line iterable instead of only a file path.

## [1.0.0] - 2021-05-21
### Changed
- `keepachangelog.to_dict` now contains `url` key for each item if a link is available for the version.
- `keepachangelog.to_raw_dict` now contains `url` key for each item if a link is available for the version.
- `keepachangelog.to_dict` now contains `semantic_version` key for each item if the version follows semantic versioning.
- `keepachangelog.to_raw_dict` now contains `semantic_version` key for each item if the version follows semantic versioning.

### Added
- `keepachangelog.release` is now allowing to provide a custom new version thanks to the new `new_version` parameter.

### Fixed
- `keepachangelog.release` now allows `pre-release` and `build metadata` information as part of valid semantic version. As per [semantic versioning specifications](https://semver.org). 
  To ensure compatibility with some python specific versioning, `pre-release` is also handled as not being prefixed with `-`, or prefixed with `.`.
- `keepachangelog.release` will now bump a pre-release version to a stable version. It was previously failing.

## [0.5.0] - 2021-04-19
### Added
- `keepachangelog.release` function to guess new version number based on `Unreleased` section, update changelog and return new version number.
- `keepachangelog.to_raw_dict` function returning a raw markdown description of the release under `raw` dict.

### Fixed
- Handle any category name.
- Add more flexibility for release format.

### Changed
- `Unreleased` is now reported as lower cased `unreleased`.

## [0.4.0] - 2020-09-21
### Added
- `keepachangelog.flask_restx.add_changelog_endpoint` function to add a changelog endpoint to a [Flask-RestX](https://flask-restx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) application.

## [0.3.1] - 2020-07-13
### Fixed
- Keep star character at the end of a line as it can be used to mark as italic.

## [0.3.0] - 2020-03-01
### Changed
- Information is now stored without star, space or caret at start or end of line.

## [0.2.0] - 2020-02-24
### Added
- It is now possible to retrieve "Unreleased" information thanks to the `show_unreleased` parameter. (Thanks [Alessandro Ogier](https://github.com/aogier))

## [0.1.0] - 2020-02-17
### Added
- `keepachangelog.starlette.add_changelog_endpoint` function to add a changelog endpoint to a [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io) application.

## [0.0.1] - 2020-02-17
